description: The cluster efficiency in bins of hadronic and EM energy in region A.
  Region A is defined as 391 cm $< r <$ 695.5 cm and 400 cm $< |z| <$ 671 cm. The
  cluster efficiency is estimated with LLPs decaying to $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$. The sample
  contains equal fractions of events with LLP mass of 7, 15, 40, and 55 GeV and LLP
  lifetime of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100m. The first hadronic energy bins correspond to LLPs
  that decayed leptonically with 0 hadronic energy. The cluster efficiency includes
  all cluster-level selections described in the paper, except for the jet veto, time
  cut, and $\Delta\phi$ cut. The full simulation signal yield prediction for samples
  with various LLP mass between 7 - 55 GeV, lifetime between 0.1 - 100 m, and decay
  mode to $d\bar{d}$ and $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ can be reproduced using this parameterization
  to within 35% and 20% for region A and B, respectively.

description: The cluster efficiency in bins of hadronic and EM energy in region B.
  Region B is defined as 671 cm $< |z| <$ 1100 cm, $r <$ 695.5 cm, and $|\eta| <$
  2. The cluster efficiency is estimated with LLPs decaying to $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$.
  The sample contains equal fractions of events with LLP mass of 7, 15, 40, and 55
  GeV and LLP lifetime of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100m. The first hadronic energy bins correspond
  to LLPs that decayed leptonically with 0 hadronic energy. The cluster efficiency
  includes all cluster-level selections described in the paper, except for the jet

  m, and decay mode to $d\bar{d}$ and $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ can be reproduced using
  this parameterization to within 35% and 20% for region A and B, respectively.

description: The efficiency of $N_{station} > 1$ requirement in bins of hadronic energy
  in region B. Region B is defined as 671 cm $< |z| <$ 1100 cm, $r <$ 695.5 cm, and
  $|\eta| <$ 2. The cluster efficiency is estimated with LLPs decaying to $\tau^{+}
  \tau^{-}$. The sample contains equal fractions of events with LLP mass of 7, 15,
  40, and 55 GeV and LLP lifetime of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100m. The first hadronic energy
  bin corresponds to LLPs that decayed leptonically with 0 hadronic energy. The efficiency
  is calculated with respect to clusters that pass all cluster-level cuts described
  in the paper, except for the jet veto, time cut, and $\Delta\phi$ cut. The full
  simulation signal yield prediction for samples with various LLP mass between 7 -
  55 GeV, lifetime between 0.1 - 100 m, and decay mode to $d\bar{d}$ and $\tau^{+}
  \tau^{-}$ can be reproduced using this parameterization to within 10%.
